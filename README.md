# Avogadro
This program was done for a university class. It requires some Java files not written by me. I have only included the code that I wrote myself.

It takes in a series of 200 images and measures the movement of the particles on each image (together the images represent Brownian motion using fluorescent imaging with each image taken 0.5 seconds apart). From these images, the movement of the particles is tracked and fitted to Einstein's kinetic theory of Brownian motion to estimate the Boltzmann constant and Avogadro's number.
